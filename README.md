# Credit-Fraud-Project
A small project using a range of machine learning models to classify fraudulent transactions from a Kaggle dataset. I used four machine learning models from the scikit-learn python library and evaluted there performence based on there precision and recall. These models were Logestic Regression,Random Forrest, Support vector machines and Multi-layer perceptron.

Logistic Regression: With the highest precision but the second lowest recall this model is best for makng sure the possible fraudulant data picked, is a true postive result. This maybe be due to this being the effect "over fitting" model of the bunch. It is able to identify common anomolies very well but not new, unseen ones, as shown by the low recall. This may not work well for predicting future events as Credit fraud is constantly changing.
